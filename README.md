This project is like a file manager having options as:
1. List all the files
2. Peform operations like creating a new file, deleting a file or searching a file

This project is done using basics of java, using just file handling and java collections.
Data structures like list, arraylist, sorting and searching are used.
This while not so advanced but gives a glimpse of what a core file manager should be capable of.
